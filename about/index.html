                <p>I am a computational biologist interested in the structure and dynamics of protein interactions. I studied biochemistry at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and later earned my Ph.D. in the lab of <a href="https://bonvinlab.org">Alexandre Bonvin</a>, working on protein interactions and structural bioinformatics. After postdoc at Stanford University with <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/levitt.html">Michael Levitt</a>, I moved to Schrodinger Inc as a Senior Scientist in the Protein Structure Prediction team.</p>
<p>I am a highly collaborative scientist, having <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UeXRdzQAAAAJ">published more than 30 articles in peer-reviewed journals</a>, which have received more than 2000 citations. My work has been funded by the <a href="https://www.nielsstensenfellowship.nl/nl">Niels Stensen Fellowship</a>, the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code program</a>, and <a href="https://molssi.org/">The Molecular Sciences Software Institute</a>, among others. As a computational biologist, I spend a significant portion of my research developing software for structural biology, most of which is available for free on my <a href="https://github.com/joaorodrigues">Github page</a>. Some of my most high-profile contributions include being a developer of <a href="https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/">HADDOCK</a> and of the <a href="https://biopython.org">Biopython project</a>, as well as being the author and lead developer of <a href="https://www.bonvinlab.org/pdb-tools">pdb-tools</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside research, I enjoy spending time building and fostering communities in computational biology. I am a certified <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> instructor, and I regularly teach Git, Python, and software development best practices to researchers. I have also helped organize several national and international conferences, including an ongoing <a href="https://meetings.embo.org/event/20-biomolecular-interactions">EMBO Practical Course</a> on modeling protein interactions.</p>
